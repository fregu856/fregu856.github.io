If you use Filterizr in your project and wish to get it featured on Filterizr's website, let me know!

## Description
Filterizr is a jQuery plugin that sorts, shuffles, searches and applies stunning filters over responsive galleries using CSS3 transitions. Write your very own, custom effects in CSS and watch your gallery come to life!

## Install
You can install Filterizr by downloading the minified version on its website/repo or through NPM/Yarn:
```
npm install filterizr
```
or
```
yarn add filterizr
```

Two files can be found in the `./dist/` directory:
* `jquery.filterizr.min.js` is only Filterizr (without jQuery in the bundle). If you choose to use this distribution you will have to make sure that jQuery is globally imported before Filterizr in your code.
* `jquery.filterizr-with-jquery.min.js` is a distribution of Filterizr with jQuery (v3.3.1) inside the bundle.

## Documentation & Tutorials
### Basic usage
If you are building a simple static website and you are already importing jQuery yourself, make sure to download the `/dist/jquery.filterizr.min.js` and simply import it after jQuery.

If you are importing Filterizr from `/node_modules`, Filterizr's default export provide you with the global jQuery object extended with the Filterizr plugin:
```import $ from 'filterizr'```

### Tutorials & Docs
You can find Filterizr's documentation as well as a series of tutorials on how to install and operate Filterizr on [the Filterizr website](http://yiotis.net/filterizr).

      <description>The header image above was generated using the text-to-image tool at imagine.art, from the input &amp;ldquo;teddy bear scientists having an intense discussion in a reading group about machine learning&amp;rdquo;.
Since I started my PhD almost five years ago (in September 2018), I have categorized, annotated and written short comments for all research papers I read in detail. I share this publicly in a GitHub repository, and recently reached 300 read papers.</description>

      <description>For a project in the doctoral course Using Maths and CS to do Social Good at Uppsala University, our goal was to make grade 7-9 students more interested in mathematics. To that end, we have created a video with an accompanying interactive blog post. In the video, we explain the essence of how machine learning works and how it can be used to help doctors discover heart attacks from patient ECGs.</description>

      <description>All code found in this blog post is also available on Google Colab where it can be executed directly in the browser.
When I first got interested in deep learning a couple of years ago, I started out using TensorFlow. In early 2018 I then decided to switch to PyTorch, a decision that I&amp;rsquo;ve been very happy with ever since. Today, the difference between the two frameworks is probably quite small in practice (and both are extensively used by researchers in the field), but I personally still find PyTorch more convenient to use.</description>

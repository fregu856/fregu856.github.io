      <description>All code found in this blog post is also available on Google Colab where it can be executed directly in the browser.
When I first got interested in deep learning a couple of years ago, I started out using TensorFlow. In early 2018 I then decided to switch to PyTorch, a decision that I&amp;rsquo;ve been very happy with ever since. Today, the difference between the two frameworks is probably quite small in practice (and both are extensively used by researchers in the field), but I personally still find PyTorch more convenient to use.</description>
